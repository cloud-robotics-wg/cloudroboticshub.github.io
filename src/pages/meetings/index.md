## Next meeting, guest talk: CloudGripper, by Florian Pokorny (2024-09-23)

This meeting, the group will host [Florian Pokorny](https://www.csc.kth.se/~fpokorny/), Associate Professor of Machine Learning at [KTH Royal Institute Technology](https://www.kth.se/) and Co-Founder of [Scaleup Robotics](https://scaleuprobotics.com/)! Florian has agreed to talk about [CloudGripper](https://cloudgripper.org/), [An Open Source Cloud Robotics Testbed for Robotic Manipulation Research, Benchmarking and Data Collection at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12786).

The talk will be recorded and hosted on YouTube, with a new blog post on our [Blogs](/blog) once it is ready!

In addition, the group plans to discuss further updates to the Cloud Robotics Hub site.

## 2024-09-09
The group discussed the launch of the new Cloud Robotics Hub
site and discussed potential improvements. Akash Vibhute from Intrinsic/OpenRMF attended and we discussed him possibly presenting to the group, potentially along the lines of his upcoming ROSCon talk.

This meeting was the first meeting following the new format. The
group members shared news about the upcoming Cloud Robotics Hub site
and discussed methods of measuring latency between sending commands
and the robot responding.

No meeting recording is available for this meeting.

## 2024-07-01

In this meeting, we had a discussion about the purpose of the
working group going forwards. We decided to change the meeting
format to focus less on group member actions and more on being a
space for cloud robotics enthusiasts can share news with each other,
with more guest speakers.

No meeting recording is available for this meeting.

## 2024-06-17

We hosted a guest in this meeting, with Gui Manzato from Ekumen
